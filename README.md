Project Overview:
This is my first-ever Power BI project, a fundamental exploration showcasing the number of banks that failed in the USA from the year 2000 to 2023. The project aims to visually represent the data obtained from data.gov online.

Data Source:
The dataset was sourced from data.gov, providing a comprehensive collection of information regarding failed banks in the United States.

Visualization Techniques:

Play Button: Implemented the use of the play button to dynamically visualize changes over time, adding a dynamic and engaging element to the presentation.
Countrows DAX Function: Utilized the countrows DAX function to efficiently calculate and represent the count of failed banks in the dataset.
Charts Used:

Stacked Bar Chart: Applied a stacked bar chart to illustrate the distribution of failed banks across different states, providing a clear visual representation of the regional impact.
Stacked Column Chart: Employed a stacked column chart to depict the monthly variations in the number of failed banks, offering insights into temporal trends.
Project Scope:
While the project may seem basic, it serves as a foundational exploration into Power BI's capabilities. It not only demonstrates the ability to fetch and manipulate data but also showcases proficiency in using dynamic features and diverse chart types for effective data communication.

Learning Experience:
This project marks a significant milestone as my introductory venture into Power BI, laying the groundwork for future, more complex analyses. The utilization of various Power BI functionalities enhances the project's educational value, providing a hands-on learning experience in data visualization and analysis.
